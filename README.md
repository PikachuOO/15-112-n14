==========

My labs and term project from Carnegie Mellon University's 15-112 course, taught by Gregory Kesden, which I took during the summer of 2014.

Most of the labs are quite simple except for Lab 7, which is Tetris.
The requirements for each lab can be viewed on Kesden's site: http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-112-n14/index/labs_index.html
